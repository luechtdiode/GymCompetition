This is all about recording, listing and sharing the gymnasts’ results and scores from the
meets, seen from the Fan-Perspective. There is no collaboration and data sharing with clubs,
sponsors or public viewers.
#### team-app
»see also: https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/team-app/id625607532?mt=8
This one is quite similar to mine idea. Instead of clubs, there can anybody declare a team
and build a downloadable app. Based on that app, collaboration between team-members is
core-feature of the app.
I'm not sure, if and how sponsors are integrated.

### Google-Play

Similar in case of data structure: Club/Team, Gymnasts, Events, Results, Scores.
Different in design for Users as follower of Gymnasts. In Contrast, the GymCompetiton-Idea
is designed for Clubs, Sponsors and Gymnasts-Follower

I'm not sure, who's responsibility it is to collect the provided information. It doesn't seem to be
a self-managed, self-serviced platform.
