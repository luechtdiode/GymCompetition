### Apple-Store

This is all about recording, listing and sharing the gymnasts’ results and scores from the
meets, seen from the Fan-Perspective. There is no collaboration and data sharing with clubs,
sponsors or public viewers.

#### team-app
»see also: https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/team-app/id625607532?mt=8
This one is quite similar to mine idea. Instead of clubs, there can anybody declare a team
and build a downloadable app. Based on that app, collaboration between team-members is
core-feature of the app.
I'm not sure, if and how sponsors are integrated.

### Google-Play

»see also: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beyondthescores.gym
Similar in case of data structure: Club/Team, Gymnasts, Events, Results, Scores.
Different in design for Users as follower of Gymnasts. In Contrast, the GymCompetiton-Idea
is designed for Clubs, Sponsors and Gymnasts-Follower

Similar in case of Data structure: Club/Team, Gymnasts, Results, Scores
Different in the point of User Groups: There are no sponsors and the Results must be
entered from the End-user. The GymCompetition-Solution is designed to provide all Results
by the club which is organizing the competition.

Canada BIM Council
CanBIM App includes access to information and links to our Regional events, Presenters,
Sponsors, Attendee profiles and much more.
I'm not sure, who's responsibility it is to collect the provided information. It doesn't seem to be
a self-managed, self-serviced platform.
